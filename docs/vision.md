# Our Vision

## Next Generation School Management

## Our Mission

To create a next-generation school lesson and rental application that revolutionizes how kitesurfing schools operate. Built by kitesurfers, for kitesurfers, we deliver live-sync planning between teachers and students, powerful revenue statistics, and intelligent lesson automation—all while keeping your data secure and protected.

## Key Features

### Live Sync Planning

Real-time synchronization between teachers and students. When a lesson is created, modified, or cancelled, all parties are instantly notified. No more miscommunication or double bookings.

### Revenue Statistics Machine

Comprehensive analytics tracking every aspect of your business. Monitor equipment usage, teacher commissions, student bookings, and overall profitability with powerful filtering and visualization tools.

### Lesson Automation

From student request to lesson completion in just 2 clicks. Automatically calculate teacher commissions, student pricing, equipment tracking, and hour confirmations. Save hours of administrative work every week.

#### From Student Request to Payment in 2 Clicks

Our automation system transforms the entire lesson lifecycle—from initial booking request to final payment—into a seamless, automated process. What used to take hours of manual coordination now happens automatically, with every detail tracked and every calculation precise.

#### The 2-Click Workflow

**Step 1: Student Requests a Package**

Students browse available packages on your school subdomain and submit a booking request. The system captures all necessary details: preferred dates, skill level, and special requirements.

What gets captured:
- Student information and contact details
- Selected package (hours, equipment type, pricing)
- Preferred dates and time slots
- Current skill level and learning goals

**Click 1: Accept the Booking**

Admin reviews the request and clicks accept. The system verifies availability and creates a confirmed booking with all package details locked in.

What happens automatically:
- Booking status changes from pending to confirmed
- Student receives confirmation notification
- Booking period and hours are locked in the system
- Equipment availability is reserved

**Click 2: Assign Teacher & Create Lesson**

Admin selects an available teacher and creates the lesson. The system automatically handles all the complex calculations and relationships.

Automatic calculations:
- Teacher commission rate applied to lesson pricing
- Student hourly rate calculated from package
- Equipment assigned and tracked for the lesson
- Lesson schedule created and synced to all portals

**Automatic Event Tracking**

Every lesson session becomes an event that automatically tracks all relevant data in real-time:

- **Teacher Commission** - Automatically calculated based on lesson hours and commission rate
- **Student Pricing** - Per-hour rate tracked against package total and remaining hours
- **Equipment Usage** - Flight hours logged for each piece of equipment used
- **Hour Confirmation** - Both teacher and student confirm actual hours taught

#### Why This Matters

- **Accurate Financials** - Every cent is tracked automatically. No more manual calculations or payment disputes
- **Zero Errors** - Automated workflows eliminate human error in bookings, scheduling, and payments
- **Save Time** - What took hours now takes 2 clicks. Spend more time on the water, less on admin

### Protected Data

Your data security is our priority. Enterprise-grade encryption, role-based access control, and regular backups ensure your school information remains safe and private.
